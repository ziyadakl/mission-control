## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Pipeline Advancement System** — New `src/lib/pipeline.ts` module for automatic workflow template progression. Handles multi-stage agent handoffs with idempotency checks and auto-dispatch.
- **Weather Location Display** — Weather widget now shows city/location name via reverse geocoding (OpenStreetMap Nominatim API).
- **Fahrenheit Support** — Weather API now defaults to Fahrenheit units, configurable via URL parameters.

### Changed

- **Dashboard UI Redesign** — Complete visual overhaul with refined dark theme using white/opacity colors instead of custom theme variables. Updated all dashboard widgets:
  - Cleaner, more modern card designs with backdrop blur
  - Refined typography with better spacing and tracking
  - Simplified color system using white opacity levels
  - Improved loading states with skeleton animations
  - Better hover states and transitions
- **Weather API Enhancements** — Added reverse geocoding, location-aware caching, and changed default location to Scranton, PA.
- **Supabase MCP Configuration** — Updated to use shell wrapper that sources `.env.local` for environment variables, with new project reference.

### Technical

- Removed accent color prop from `WidgetCard` component in favor of unified design system
- Updated weather cache to include location key for proper cache invalidation
- Enhanced weather error handling and fallback behavior

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### 🔒 Security

- **API Authentication Middleware** — Bearer token authentication for all API routes. Set `MC_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local` to enable. Same-origin browser requests are automatically allowed.
- **Webhook HMAC-SHA256 Validation** — Agent completion webhooks now require a valid `X-Webhook-Signature` header. Set `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` to enable.
- **Path Traversal Protection** — File download endpoint now uses `realpathSync` to resolve symlinks and validate all paths are within the allowed directory.
- **Error Message Sanitization** — API error responses no longer leak internal details (stack traces, file paths) in production.
- **Security Headers** — Added `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` headers via Next.js config.
- **Input Validation (Zod)** — Request payloads for tasks, agents, and workspaces are validated with Zod schemas before processing.
- **Repository Audit** — Purged sensitive files from git history, updated `.gitignore` to block database files and backups.

### Added

- **Ed25519 Device Identity** — Gateway pairing now uses Ed25519 key-based device identity for secure handshakes.
- **ARIA Hook** — Real-time agent tracking bridge between ARIA and Mission Control (`scripts/aria-mc-hook.sh`).
- **Planning Poll Endpoint** — New `POST /api/tasks/[id]/planning/poll` for long-poll planning updates.
- **Retry Dispatch** — New `POST /api/tasks/[id]/planning/retry-dispatch` to retry failed task dispatches.
- **Auto-Dispatch Module** — `src/lib/auto-dispatch.ts` for automatic task assignment after planning.
- **Planning Utilities** — `src/lib/planning-utils.ts` with shared planning logic.
- **MC Bridge Scripts** — Python and shell bridge scripts for external integrations.

### Changed

- **Node.js v25 Support** — Updated `better-sqlite3` to v12.6.2 for Node v25 compatibility.
- **Default Port** — Mission Control now defaults to port 4000 (previously 3000).
- **Improved Planning Tab** — Enhanced UI with better question rendering, progress tracking, and error handling.
- **Agent Sidebar Improvements** — Better status display, model selection, and agent management.
- **Activity Log Overhaul** — Cleaner timeline UI with better type icons and formatting.
- **Live Feed Improvements** — Better real-time event display with filtering options.

### Fixed

- **Same-origin browser requests** — Auth middleware no longer blocks the UI's own API calls.
