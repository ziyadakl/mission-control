# Context:

I need you to help me figure out a way to make money. I don’t have a degree. I have time and energy. I’m aiming for about $70,000 a year—nothing crazy right now. I have responsibilities, so I need a plan that works with them. I’m asking for your help to think outside the box and get creative about money-making ideas. I’ll be studying something in the meantime, but this is urgent and immediate; I need to start now, and it shouldn’t depend on waiting for rewards. I’m currently pursuing my degree, but that’s not a constraint. As long as there’s something that can earn money with transferable skills, I’m in.

I don’t want a job in construction, plumbing, or anything similar. I’m studying in the tech field. I know the field is saturated, so I don’t necessarily need to stay in tech, but I want something that isn’t blue-collar.

PLEASE MAKE SURE YOURE NOT RESEARCHING SOLUTIONS THAT WILL BE 70K IN 12 MONTHS. ITS GOTTA BE NOW. I NEED MONEY NEXT MONTH. AND DO NOT GIVE ME COMMISSION OR SALES BASED RECS

Remote is prioritized for me, or temporarily around scranton PA for the next 3 months, or in north/central NJ starting June

do you have experience with specific platforms, languages, or tools? (e.g., Python, Excel/Google Sheets, automation tools like n8n, data entry, WordPress, any design software, etc.) - I dont have real coding skills that would pass technical interviews. I am able to use a LOT of things and have very good understanding, but I lean on ai a little bit. For speed and effeciency, and because I already pay for these ai services

9–10 hours/day. I am flexible. I just need to be able to make money ASAP. can work evenings/weekends/flexible blocks

guaranteed hourly/salary pay only

freelance/contract roles where solving problems for clients using those tools is harder to land because I have to wait for something to come in, I prefer an employee/contract role with a company

I've got tolerance for high-structure/high-accountability environments like ops and automation at Affinity. I would be comfortable in roles with heavy monitoring (e.g., data QA with accuracy SLAs, or compliance/admin roles with strict processes)

But I do prefer some autonomy in how you solve problems as long as output is clear

I dont like anything call center based.

Industry preference beyond real estate, I am open to similar ops/admin/automation roles in other industries (insurance, logistics, fintech, healthcare admin, SaaS operations, etc.), but staying closer to real estate/proptech is good as well because the domain knowledge transfers

# Fastest paths to a $70K operations role starting in March

**You can realistically be employed within 2–4 weeks.** The remote operations and no-code automation job market is highly active in February 2026, with hundreds of open positions matching your exact skill set. Your combination of Director of Operations experience, Airtable/Make.com/n8n proficiency, and AI-assisted workflows is a genuinely rare and in-demand profile — especially in the growing "ops-tech hybrid" niche that commands **$72K–$90K** at the mid-level. The fastest route to income is a two-pronged blitz: register with 3–5 staffing agencies this week (contract roles can start within days) while simultaneously applying to the best-fit direct-hire postings below.

## The market validates your $70K target — and possibly more

Salary data across multiple sources confirms **$70K sits comfortably within range** for the roles that match your profile. Operations Specialist roles carry a national median of **$72,251** (Glassdoor, 11,600+ salary reports). Automation Specialists average **$76,500–$77,750**. No-code-specific roles skew even higher, with Airtable specialists commanding $60K–$200K and workflow automation roles averaging $65K–$90K.

Your Director of Operations title combined with no-code automation skills is a differentiator that most candidates at the $70K level lack. Companies increasingly want people who can both *manage* operations and *automate* them — not just one or the other. This positions you to negotiate toward the **$75K–$85K** range at SaaS and fintech companies, while $65K–$75K is the floor at smaller startups and staffing placements.

The role titles that best capture your skills and hit the salary target are, in priority order: **Operations Specialist**, **Automation & Systems Specialist**, **Workflow Automation Specialist**, **CRM Administrator**, **RevOps Coordinator**, and **Business Systems Analyst**. Use these exact titles in job searches.

## No-code automation is a booming niche with dedicated job boards

Beyond the mainstream job boards, several specialized platforms cater specifically to no-code and automation talent. These are where companies post when they specifically want someone with your Airtable/Make.com/n8n skill set:

- **Airtable Community Jobs Board** (community.airtable.com) — Active listings from companies seeking Airtable builders and automation specialists. Contract roles at $50/hr are common.
- **n8n Community Jobs Board** (community.n8n.io/c/jobs/13) — n8n-specific roles posted directly by hiring companies.
- **NoCode Alliance** (nocodealliance.org/jobs) — Aggregates no-code and AI developer positions.
- **Optimize IS** (optimizeis.com/careers) — A leading Airtable consultancy that's remote-first and actively hiring developers, training specialists, and account managers. They use Airtable + Zapier + Make daily. This company is an exceptionally strong culture fit.

Glassdoor currently shows **388 remote no-code/low-code jobs**, **111 Zapier automation jobs**, and **62 n8n-specific jobs**. The market is robust and growing — the global no-code market is projected to reach $102.7 billion by 2031.

**One critical warning:** many "automation specialist" postings on mainstream job boards actually refer to QA/test automation (software testing), not workflow automation. Filter carefully — look for keywords like "Zapier," "Make," "Airtable," "workflow," "business process," or "no-code" to confirm you're finding the right roles.

## Target these companies and industries directly

Several remote-first companies are natural homes for your skill set and regularly hire operations/automation talent:

**Best-fit companies for your profile:** Zapier (they literally sell automation), Optimize IS (Airtable consultancy), Chili Piper (revenue operations platform), and Automattic (WordPress parent — uses paid trial projects instead of traditional interviews, ideal for demonstrating skills over credentials). **GitLab** and **Buffer** also maintain large remote operations teams with structured but autonomous cultures.

**Industries ranked by opportunity volume and fit for your background:**

1. **SaaS Operations** — Highest volume of remote roles, best match for automation skills, most companies understand the value of no-code expertise
2. **Fintech** — Strong demand, competitive salaries ($66K–$147K range for operations roles), many remote options. Companies like Ramp, TrueML, and Settle are actively hiring.
3. **Healthcare Admin/Tech** — Rapidly growing remote operations market (701 jobs on Glassdoor). Tarpon Health is hiring a Junior Automation Specialist specifically for RPA and API work.
4. **PropTech** — Your real estate background is a direct advantage here. Target Agora, Northspyre, Luxury Presence, and AppFolio. Smaller market but less competition for your specific combination of skills.
5. **Insurtech** — Companies like Sure, CoverGo (59 remote jobs posted, including Operations roles), and Zywave are remote-first. **Caution:** many insurtech listings are commission-based sales roles disguised as operations. Filter carefully.

**you're not just an operations coordinator — you're an ops-tech hybrid**, and that positioning commands higher pay and faster hiring. The no-code automation niche is undersupplied with candidates who also have real operational leadership experience. Lead every application and recruiter conversation with "Director of Operations who automates workflows using Airtable, Make.com, and n8n" rather than listing these as secondary skills. direct applications to the high-fit postings above offer the best shot at a $70K+ permanent role starting by mid-to-late March.
