## Deployment on production server

### Steps
1. [ ] SSH into production server
2. [ ] Navigate to project directory
3. [ ] Pull latest from git (`git pull origin main`)
4. [ ] Install dependencies (`npm install`)
5. [ ] Backup existing database (if any)
6. [ ] Start dev server (`npm run dev`)
7. [ ] Verify SSE connection in browser console
8. [ ] Test real-time updates with two browser windows
9. [ ] Create test task and verify activity log
10. [ ] Add test deliverable via API
11. [ ] Check agent counter updates

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] SSE connection established (browser console: "[SSE] Connected")
- [ ] Tasks update in real-time across windows
- [ ] Activity log displays correctly
- [ ] Deliverables tab works
- [ ] Sessions tab works
- [ ] Agent counter shows live count
- [ ] No memory leaks after 1 hour runtime

## Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check server logs for SSE connection count
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Verify database file size reasonable
- [ ] Check for error logs
- [ ] Test under normal load

### User Feedback
- [ ] User can see real-time updates
- [ ] Task detail tabs are intuitive
- [ ] Activity log provides useful information
- [ ] Agent counter is accurate
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues arise:
1. Stop the server
2. Git revert to previous commit
3. Restart server
4. Report issues

Previous stable commit: (check `git log` before deployment)
