❯ You are an engineer optimizing my OpenClaw deployment for maximum cost efficiency. My deployment is through a VPS
  https://srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net

  this current directory you are in is just an older documentation, that we used to set up the server and
  stuff

  Your goal is to reduce unnecessary token spending by 95 to 97 percent by fixing context bloat, session history behavior, model routing,
  caching, and rate-limit pacing, using the principles described in Matt Ganzak’s OpenClaw optimization guide.

  Work in this order:

  Phase 1: Audit (read-only)

  Analyze the currently running OpenClaw directory, including configuration files, agent definitions, model settings, heartbeat logic, messaging
  integrations (Slack, WhatsApp, etc.), memory storage, and any API wrappers.

  Produce an “Audit Findings” summary that clearly lists:
      •    What is implemented, partially implemented, or missing for each requirement below
      •    Where it is implemented (file paths and key functions/modules)
      •    The current token and context behavior (what gets sent per heartbeat and per message)
      •    Any clear cost drivers (context size growth, repeated history injection, missing caching, etc.)

  Do not change code until the audit summary is complete.

  Phase 2: Implement Improvements (make code changes)

  Implement the following optimizations if missing or inefficient. If something cannot be implemented due to limitations of the current
  architecture, propose the smallest viable modification that achieves the same outcome.

  1) Multi-model routing with local Ollama

  Objective: Use the cheapest capable model for each task.

  Required behavior:
      •    Confirm the config supports multiple model definitions and a default model.
      •    Implement model segmentation and routing across:
      •    Ollama (local): heartbeats and “brainless” tasks (idle pings, file/data organization, basic checks)
      •    Haiku: high-volume research and basic info gathering
      •    Sonnet: drafting, outreach, moderate reasoning, coding
      •    Opus: complex reasoning only, used via escalation
      •    Explicitly route all heartbeats to Ollama so idle operation costs $0.

  Deliverable:
      •    Routing rules (or a router module) that selects the correct model based on task type and complexity.
      •    Clear config changes showing model definitions and defaults.

  2) Context and session history management

  Objective: Stop sending bloated context or entire message histories on every call.

  Required behavior:
      •    Heartbeats must not load full context files or long session histories.
      •    General prompts should load only necessary context, not “everything by default.”
      •    Fix Slack/WhatsApp session bloat:
      •    Identify whether OpenClaw is sending the full channel/chat history with every prompt.
      •    Implement a new_session (or equivalent) command that:
      •    Removes prior session history from the active prompt context
      •    Preserves it in long-term memory for later recall when explicitly needed
      •    Prevents rate-limit issues caused by massive prompt payloads

  Deliverable:
      •    A clear mechanism for selective context loading
      •    A session-clearing command wired into messaging integrations
      •    Proof in code that heartbeats use minimal context

  3) Task escalation and fallback chain

  Objective: Start cheap, escalate only when needed.

  Required behavior:
      •    Default to the cheapest viable model (Ollama or Haiku).
      •    If output is invalid, incomplete, blocked, or fails validation, automatically escalate:
      1.    Ollama or Haiku
      2.    Sonnet
      3.    Opus (last resort)

  Deliverable:
      •    A deterministic escalation policy with explicit failure criteria
      •    Logging that shows when and why escalation occurs

  4) Efficiency metrics, token calibration, and caching

  Objective: Make “low token usage” a first-class success metric and reduce repetition costs.

  Required behavior:
      •    Update agent/system instructions to include:
      •    “Run efficiently”
      •    “Optimize for low token usage”
      •    Implement token reporting:
      •    Estimate token cost before major tasks
      •    Report actual usage after completion (per call and per task)
      •    Enable and use Anthropic caching (if available in this setup) for repetitive research and repeated prompt prefixes.
      •    Add caching for internal or external retrieval patterns that are frequently repeated.

  Deliverable:
      •    Token estimation + actual usage reporting surfaced in logs or task output
      •    Caching enabled and demonstrably used on eligible calls
      •    A short list of best caching candidates discovered in the codebase

  5) Rate-limit pacing and queuing

  Objective: Avoid 429s and throttling loops that waste tokens and time.

  Required behavior:
      •    Audit API call patterns and identify rate-limit failure points.
      •    Implement pacing or a queue for outbound API calls, especially for messaging platform triggers and high-frequency tasks.

  Deliverable:
      •    A pacing mechanism (backoff, queue, scheduler, or token-bucket style limiter)
      •    Logs indicating rate-limit handling and reduced retry storms

  Verification and Reporting (required)

  After changes, provide a structured report with:
      •    Status of each requirement (implemented / partially / not applicable)
      •    Exact files changed and what changed
      •    Before/after measurements where possible:
      •    Context size sent on heartbeat and on a typical message
      •    Token usage for representative tasks
      •    Frequency of model usage (target distribution: majority on Ollama/Haiku, minority on Sonnet, rare on Opus)
      •    Any remaining bottlenecks and the next highest ROI improvements

  Primary objective: elegant, minimal, measurable changes that reduce unnecessary token spend by 95%+.

  ---
  Phase 1: Audit Findings

  Current Architecture

  - OpenClaw gateway v2026.2.13 (user-level systemd)
  - 2 live agents (main, worker) + 27 workflow agents
  - All API calls go through: OpenRouter, OpenAI Codex, Groq, Cerebras, Google Gemini
  - No local model (Ollama) installed
  - Telegram as sole messaging channel
  - 6 cron jobs (5 enabled)

  Top Cost Drivers (ranked by impact)

  1. Session history bloat — CRITICAL

  - main agent: 37MB across 294 session files, largest is 3.9MB
  - sessions.json index: 888KB / 12,557 lines
  - Feature-dev agents: additional 8MB combined
  - Every new session potentially loads recent session context via memorySearch
  - 2 stuck messages in delivery-queue citing "Context overflow: prompt too large"

  2. Cron jobs wrapping bash scripts in AI calls — HIGH

  - system:watchdog (every 3h): runs a bash script but pays for an AI turn to execute it
  - system:dst-adjust (daily): runs bash dst-adjust.sh but pays for an AI turn
  - antfarm:stuck-run-guard (every 90min): lightweight check, but full AI session each time
  - system:daily-summary and system:weekly-summary: large prompts with inline file reads

  3. No model routing by complexity — HIGH

  - Default primary: openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5 (not free)
  - main agent primary: openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-flash (not free either)
  - Cron jobs use openrouter/openrouter/free or openrouter/openrouter/auto
  - No local model tier for $0 operation
  - No escalation chain — model is fixed per agent/cron

  4. Context loading on every session start — MEDIUM

  - AGENTS.md mandates reading 5 files (SOUL.md, USER.md, OPERATING_CONTRACT.md, memory files, MEMORY.md) = ~6-8KB injected on every boot
  - bootstrapMaxChars: 8000 but contextTokens: 80000 — sessions can grow enormous before compaction
  - Compaction threshold at 60K tokens is very high

  5. No caching — MEDIUM

  - No prompt prefix caching configured
  - Repeated workspace docs sent fresh every session
  - No response caching for identical queries

  6. Rate limit exhaustion causing cascading failures — MEDIUM

  - OpenRouter daily limit hit → all cron jobs fail simultaneously
  - Auto-compaction fails (needs tokens) → context overflow → delivery failures
  - No pacing, no backoff, no token-bucket

  7. Config bugs burning tokens on errors

  - system:weekly-summary uses openrouter/auto (invalid) — should be openrouter/openrouter/auto
  - Duplicate quoted model entries: "\"openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5\""
  - Watchdog crontab monitors dead openclaw.service instead of running openclaw-gateway.service

  Phase 2: Implementation

  Let me start implementing. I'll work in priority order.

⏺ First, let me check if OpenClaw supports Ollama, and what the CLI can do for session management.

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "openclaw --help 2>&1 | head -60; echo '==='; openclaw model --help 2>&1; echo '==='; openclaw session

     … +52 lines (ctrl+o to expand)
  ⎿  (timeout 30s)

⏺ Good — x86_64, 8GB RAM, 2 CPUs. Ollama is feasible with a small model. The default model is broken ("missing"). Let me start fixing.

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "cp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.pre-optimization-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)" 2>&1)
  ⎿  (No output)

⏺ Now let me do the high-impact changes in parallel:

⏺ Bash(Purge old sessions on VPS)
  ⎿  Backgrounded agent (shift+↑ to manage · ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Bash(Install Ollama on VPS)
  ⎿  Backgrounded agent (shift+↑ to manage · ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ While those background tasks run, let me fix the config and cron jobs directly — these are the highest-impact changes.

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "
      # Remove duplicate quoted model entries…)
  ⎿  Config path not found: agents.defaults.models."openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5"

  ⎿  Removed: "openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5"

     === Dupes cleaned ===
     … +6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)
  ⎿  (timeout 30s)

⏺ Now fix the cron jobs — this is where most waste happens:

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "
      # Fix weekly-summary model (was 'openrouter/auto', should be 'openrouter/openrouter/auto')…)
  ⎿  system:watchdog: model -> groq/qwen3-32b, timeout 60s
     system:daily-summary: model -> google/gemini-2.5-flash
     system:weekly-summary: model -> google/gemini-2.5-flash
     … +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now stagger the cron schedules to avoid rate-limit pile-ups:

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "
      python3 -c \"…)
  ⎿  system:watchdog: moved to :05
     system:daily-summary: moved to :35
     system:weekly-summary: moved to :45, reset errors
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now update workspace docs — reduce HEARTBEAT.md, add efficiency directives, and trim SOUL.md:

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net 'cat > /home/deploy/.openclaw/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md << '\''ENDOFFILE'\''
      # HEARTBEAT.md…)
  ⎿  HEARTBEAT.md updated

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net 'cat > /home/deploy/.openclaw/workspace/EFFICIENCY.md << '\''ENDOFFILE'\''

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net '
      # Update AGENTS.md to reference EFFICIENCY.md and reduce mandatory file reads…)
  ⎿  AGENTS.md updated

⏺ Now add the session-clearing mechanism and fix the watchdog script:

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net '
      # Create a session cleanup script that can be triggered via /new_session command…)
  ⎿  session-cleanup.sh created
     watchdog fixed to monitor correct service

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net '

⏺ Task Output(non-blocking) ab02e38
  ⎿  Read output (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Session cleanup done (71 old files archived). Let me check Ollama progress:

⏺ Task Output(non-blocking) ac6945a
  ⎿  Read output (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Ollama installation blocked — deploy user needs a sudo password. I'll come back to this. Let me continue with the remaining optimizations.

⏺ The cron model changes were already done. Let me now convert the DST-adjust and watchdog from AI-wrapped to pure bash cron (no AI turn needed at
  all):

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "
      # The dst-adjust and watchdog don't need an AI turn AT ALL…)

     … +38 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The dst-adjust.sh is doubly wasteful — it's an OpenClaw AI cron that spawns ANOTHER AI turn inside. And the watchdog is running in BOTH system
  crontab AND OpenClaw cron. Let me fix this:

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "
      # Check if openclaw cron has a direct update command…)
  ⎿  🦞 OpenClaw 2026.2.9 (33c75cb) — Your .env is showing; don't worry, I'll pretend I didn't see it.

  ⎿  dst-adjust.sh rewritten (no AI turn)
     Disabled OpenClaw cron: system:watchdog (already in system crontab)
     Disabled OpenClaw cron: system:dst-adjust (moved to system crontab)
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Context reduction and session management — let me also trim the SOUL.md session init section and slim down OPERATING_CONTRACT.md:

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "
      # Update SOUL.md session initialization section to reinforce efficiency…)
  ⎿  SOUL.md updated

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "

  ⎿  32000
     4000
     {
     … +12 lines (ctrl+o to expand)
  ⎿  (timeout 15s)

⏺ Now the pacing — the remaining OpenClaw crons (daily-summary, weekly-summary, stuck-run-guard) are already staggered. Let me also reduce the
  stuck-run-guard frequency and add provider rotation:

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "
      python3 -c \"…)
  ⎿  system:daily-summary: timeout set to 120s
     system:weekly-summary: timeout set to 180s
     antfarm:stuck-run-guard: slowed to every 3h at :20, timeout 90s
     Pacing changes applied.

⏺ Now restart the gateway to apply all config changes:

⏺ Bash(ssh deploy@srv1360790.tail30bf7c.ts.net "
      export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/\$(id -u)…)

  ⎿  (timeout 30s)

⏺ Gateway restarted successfully and healthy. Let me do a final verification of all changes:

  3. New Files Created

  - EFFICIENCY.md — Token economy rules loaded every session
  - session-cleanup.sh — Automated session archival script

  4. Bug Fixes

  - Removed 2 phantom model entries ("openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5" with quotes)
  - Fixed weekly-summary model (openrouter/auto → valid google/gemini-2.5-flash)
  - Fixed watchdog script (was monitoring dead openclaw.service, now monitors openclaw-gateway.service)
  - Reset error counters on fixed cron jobs
  - Staggered all cron schedules (no more simultaneous :00 firing)
